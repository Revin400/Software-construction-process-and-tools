Recently, we acquired a new client, CargoHub. This company specializes in the handling and storage of goods.

Currently, they use a piece of software with an API that is used for various applications to centrally process their data and enforce or initiate certain critical process flows. We have received this software to further develop it. Unfortunately, the software lacks documentation or explanation of what it exactly does, and there are other crucial components missing for us as a software company (tests, repositories, documentation, reports, etc.).

The previous software company that developed the software is no longer active, so we cannot request any explanation/documentation from them. As the development team, you are now responsible for this software and will need to start mapping out the software’s requirements and documenting them. Of course, we can verify these requirements with CargoHub to ensure that all requirements are indeed covered by the current software. Additionally, you’ll need to test the software to determine if there is sufficient coverage and if all components are truly addressed. You should also consider any new requirements. Since we work internally with development pipelines and repositories, it’s necessary to set up the standard software development processes for this project, which includes:

- Repository
- Setting up project software
- Testing environment
- CI/CD
